# Rolling_Gravity
A physics rolling ball demo made in Unreal Engine 4, allows the player to roll up walls and ceilings with simulated physics
The included files are classes that were built for the project in Unreal Engine 4 and only include the files I created
Each class has is made to handle anything about itself and only casts to other objects and files if it is needed, for example adding impulse in a direction using the boost pad, this needs to cast to the player pawn so the function can be called.
